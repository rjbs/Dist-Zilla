          MakeMaker-generated Makefile.PL now only has configure_requires of
          6.30 so dists can be installed on RHEL5

4.101800  2010-06-29 10:29:38 America/New_York
          during dist minting, ModuleMaker occurs before FileGatherer

          ModuleBuild's module_build argument generation is now a method

          Dist::Zilla is now an abstract base class, basically

          * Dist::Zilla::Dist::Builder and ::Minter perform the real work

          * Dist::Zilla::Tester has been updated to work with these

          a very basic test for minting, now possible, has been added

          added prune_file method to Dist::Zilla to eliminate the need for
          altering the ->files arrayref directly

          added the ClearPrereqs plugin

          [Prereq] is now called [Prereqs], but [Prereq] will continue to work
          until v6 or v7 or so

4.101780  2010-06-27 14:30:55 America/New_York
          the Chrome role now requires three input methods: prompt_any_key,
          prompt_yn, and prompt_str

          Term and Test chrome now implement the required input methods

          ConfirmRelease now uses Chrome to prompt for input

          `dzil setup` added to create a starting config.ini

4.101612  2010-06-10 12:12:00 America/New_York
          The PAUSE indexer will not be pleased. The 4.101610 PkgVersion
          changes are entirely reverted.

4.101611  2010-06-10 11:37:52 America/New_York
          added nonsensical $VERSION = $VERSION to appease the PAUSE indexer
          and other garbage code that evals a single line to guess at the
          version's value

4.101610  2010-06-10 10:01:37 America/New_York
          Fix Win32 \r\n emission. \r\n is only emitted now if its there in
          the original code. Tests included to make sure DZil doesn't sufer
          the problem under itself on windows. (Kent Fredric)

          Fix Tar permissions. (Kent Fredric, stolen from Module::Build)

          @Filter can now pass arguments along to the filter if you use a new
          dash-prefix config convention.  Consult its documentation for more
          information.  (Florian Ragwitz)

          PkgVersion now adds the version assignment to the same line as the
          package declaration to avoid altering line numbering.  (David
          Golden)

4.101582  2010-06-07 18:23:04 America/New_York
          improve tests to work with new CPAN::Meta

          a few improvements to use of type constraints in Zilla.pm

          some methods that were undocumented have been _-prefixed

          ModuleBuild now turns on recursive_test_files unconditionally

          the install_command argument to $zilla->install should now be an
          arrayref

          suppressed a stringifying-undef warning when using UploadToCPAN

          no longer try to compose an obsolete Dist::Zilla::Config role

4.101540  2010-06-03 23:52:52 America/New_York
          INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

          New global config system!

          Your ~/.dzil/config.ini is now broken.  Running `dzil` should tell
          you how to fix it.  Probably just replace [!release] with [%PAUSE]
          and delete everything else.  Hope that helps!

          Major refactoring of our use of Config::MVP; this probably won't
          break anything unless you wrote your own config readers, which I'm
          pretty sure you haven't done!

          config parameters beginning with a colon are not passed to plugins
          (this should not really affect anyone)

          OTHER CHANGES:

          plugins are now registered as soon as their config section has been
          read

          Dist::Zilla::Role::Stash has been added

          :version can now be passed as a config section value to require that
          the config's package be of the specified version

          reserved config property names (plugin_name, zilla) are now fatal
          during config read rather than plugin instantiation

          core license attrs will look in the %Rights stash for defaults

          `dzil new` will work if you have no configured profiles

          generated Makefile.PL no longer has trailing spaces (Florian Ragwitz)

          Document 'user' parameter for :FakeRelease (Kent Fredric)

          will probably work just fine on Win32 now!

3.101520  2010-06-01 11:50:16 America/New_York
          unixify all gathered filenames (Christian Walde)

          ModuleBuild can use a custom M::B class (David Golden, Dave Rolsky)

          set release_status distmeta based on is_trial (Apocalypse)

          PkgVersion ignores packages which have a newline between the package
          keyword and the package name (Dave Rolsky)

          PkgVersion and PodVersion

          Walde)

3.101390  2010-05-19 09:15:32 America/New_York
          INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

          the as_distmeta method of Prereqs is removed

          the ->prereq method on Dist::Zilla is gone (only prereqs remains)

          distmeta is managed by CPAN::Meta, which expects v2 spec data by
          default

          most Dist::Zilla::Types are gone, now in MooseX::Types::Perl

          OTHER CHANGES:

          META.json and META.yml are now produced by CPAN::Meta

          Dist::Zilla::Prereqs now proxies for CPAN::Meta::Prereqs

          MetaResources supports CPAN Meta Spec version 2, but still works
            with old-style resources as well (Dave Rolsky)

          quote filenames with spaces in MANIFEST (Dave Rolsky)

          Manifest plugin is now a FileGatherer, not an InstallTool

          attempted a fix for `dzil install` on Win32 (RT #57404)

2.101310  2010-05-11 09:02:45 America/New_York
          update_filename arg added to NextRelease

            Smidsrød)

          the new `dzil new` does stuff, but is not documented

          add a "user" parameter to FakeRelease (David Golden)

2.101160  2010-04-26 19:51:52 America/New_York
          `dzil new` now does nothing and says so

          easy bundles will less often create names with @@ in them

2.101151  2010-04-25 23:40:28 America/New_York
          GatherDir and PruneCruft now both have verbose log output

          the App config system has been moved and made non-public; it was
          crazy and awful

          version numbers are not validated by version.pm, not my own dumb
          regex

          `dzil clean` no longer removes backup~ files (sorry, jq)

          TestRelease is better about picking a build location (Christopher J.

          delegate logging to the Dist::Zilla::App object
          the controller attribute is now called "chrome"; this should last
          replace File::chdir with File::pushd (David Golden)

2.100922  2010-04-02 18:53:55 America/New_York
          BuildRunner and TestRunner routines now must die, not return errors
