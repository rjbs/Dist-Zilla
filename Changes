3.101390  2010-05-19 09:15:32 America/New_York
          INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

          the as_distmeta method of Prereqs is removed

          the ->prereq method on Dist::Zilla is gone (only prereqs remains)

          distmeta is managed by CPAN::Meta, which expects v2 spec data by
          default

          most Dist::Zilla::Types are gone, now in MooseX::Types::Perl

          OTHER CHANGES:

          META.json and META.yml are now produced by CPAN::Meta

          Dist::Zilla::Prereqs now proxies for CPAN::Meta::Prereqs

          MetaResources supports CPAN Meta Spec version 2, but still works
            with old-style resources as well (Dave Rolsky)

          quote filenames with spaces in MANIFEST (Dave Rolsky)

          Manifest plugin is now a FileGatherer, not an InstallTool

          attempted a fix for `dzil install` on Win32 (RT #57404)

2.101310  2010-05-11 09:02:45 America/New_York
          update_filename arg added to NextRelease

2.101151  2010-04-25 23:40:28 America/New_York
          GatherDir and PruneCruft now both have verbose log output

          the App config system has been moved and made non-public; it was
          crazy and awful

          version numbers are not validated by version.pm, not my own dumb
          regex

          `dzil clean` no longer removes backup~ files (sorry, jq)

          TestRelease is better about picking a build location (Christopher J.
          Madsen)

          added @Basic, more suitable for basic use than @Classic
          delegate logging to the Dist::Zilla::App object
          the controller attribute is now called "chrome"; this should last
          replace File::chdir with File::pushd (David Golden)

2.100922  2010-04-02 18:53:55 America/New_York
