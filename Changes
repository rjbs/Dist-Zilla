        - add default_jobs attribute to TestRunner role
        - fix the behavior of 'dzil add' with more than one file

        - META.json is now a UTF-8 file, rather than ASCII
        - document the use of filefinders in [PkgVersion], and remove
          filtering out of .t, .pod files; do skip non-text files, though
        - always load modules in "extra tests" like pod-coverage.t

          action at a distance
        - PkgVersion no longer surrounds the new $VERSION assignment with a
          bare block
        - if there's a blank line after the package statement (and any number
          of comment-only lines), PkgVersion will use that for a $VERSION
          assignment, rather than insert a new line; this can be made mandatory
          with die_on_line_insertion

5.009     2014-01-07 20:21:17-05:00 America/New_York

        - add the ability to say "dzil run --no-build" to run a command without
          building inside the dist dir
          (in other words, no `perl Makefile.PL && make`)
        - Archive::Tar::Wrapper added as a recommended prereq
        - fix :ShareFiles (thanks, Christopher J. Madsen and Karen Etheridge)
        - new :AllFiles and :NoFiles filefinders (thanks, Karen Etheridge)
        - most files generated by dzil plugins now self-identify with comments

5.006     2013-11-06 09:21:12 America/New_York
        - add ->is_bytes to files; shortcut for ->encoding eq 'bytes'
          (thanks, David Golden)
        - AutoPrereqs will not try scanning binary files (thanks, David Golden)

5.005     2013-11-02 16:32:04 America/New_York
        - add --keep-build-dir to "dzil test" and "dzil install"

          David Golden)

4.300038  2013-09-08 09:18:34 America/New_York
        - add horrible hack to avoid generating non-UTF-8 META.yml; seriously,
          don't look at the code!  Thanks, David Golden, whose code was simple
          and probably much, much saner, but didn't cover as many cases as rjbs
          wanted to cover.

4.300037  2013-08-28 21:43:36 America/New_York

          check fails (thanks, Karen Etheridge!)

          by phase and type, in readable JSON format (thanks, Karen Etheridge!)

        - improve errors when there's not enough configuration and no global
          config file can be found (thanks, Dimitar Petrov)

        - delay loading yet more libraries until needed (thanks, Olivier
          Mengué!)

          (thanks, Mike Doherty)

        - allow :version directive in root section to require a given version
          of Dist::Zilla

        - simply and speedify some of GatherDir (Thanks, Olivier Mengué!)

4.300028  2012-10-19 10:50:42 America/New_York
        - when picking modules to treat as "part of the dist," be more lax in
          understanding libraries under ./t:  ./t/lib/Foo.pm is now treated as
          providing t::lib::Foo, lib::Foo, and Foo

4.300027  2012-10-16 21:07:06 America/New_York
        - the "latest" symlink code broke Dist::Zilla on win32; fixed now!

          bundle required (thanks, Rob Hoelz)

4.300025  2012-10-07 23:02:33 America/New_York
        - add the LicenseProvider and NameProvider roles (thanks, Vyacheslav

          name_is_template option (Thanks, Karen Etheridge!)

        - properly set the working directory when testing (thanks, Jesse
          Luehrs!)

4.300019  2012-06-20 15:36:01 America/New_York

        - The GatherDir::Template documentation has been improved
          (Thanks, Christopher J. Madsen!)

        - Prereqs now actually understands -relationship as documented
          in 4.300004.  Also, it throws an error if you give it a

          highest required perl of either runtime or built requires.  (Thanks,
          Christopher J. Madsen!)

        - Test routines should now properly report the calling line for
          failures ($Test::Builder::Level is being set) (Thanks, Christopher J.
          Madsen!)

          performance of Perl file munging and scanning.  The PPI role was
          added.  (Thanks, Dave Rolsky!)

        - We now use Archive::Tar::Wrapper if available, to speed up archive
          building.  (Thanks, Dave Rolsky!)

          should fix bugs in "dzil release --trial" and probably other related
          bugs

4.200014  2011-08-07 18:18:01 America/New_York

          ModuleBuild's module_build argument generation is now a method

          Dist::Zilla is now an abstract base class, basically

          * Dist::Zilla::Dist::Builder and ::Minter perform the real work

          * Dist::Zilla::Tester has been updated to work with these

          a very basic test for minting, now possible, has been added

          added prune_file method to Dist::Zilla to eliminate the need for
          altering the ->files arrayref directly

          added the ClearPrereqs plugin

4.101611  2010-06-10 11:37:52 America/New_York
          added nonsensical $VERSION = $VERSION to appease the PAUSE indexer

4.101610  2010-06-10 10:01:37 America/New_York
          Fix Win32 \r\n emission. \r\n is only emitted now if its there in

          Fix Tar permissions. (Kent Fredric, stolen from Module::Build)

          @Filter can now pass arguments along to the filter if you use a new
          dash-prefix config convention.  Consult its documentation for more
          information.  (Florian Ragwitz)

          PkgVersion now adds the version assignment to the same line as the
          package declaration to avoid altering line numbering.  (David
          Golden)

          no longer try to compose an obsolete Dist::Zilla::Config role

4.101540  2010-06-03 23:52:52 America/New_York
          INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

          New global config system!

          Your ~/.dzil/config.ini is now broken.  Running `dzil` should tell
          you how to fix it.  Probably just replace [!release] with [%PAUSE]
          and delete everything else.  Hope that helps!

          Major refactoring of our use of Config::MVP; this probably won't
          break anything unless you wrote your own config readers, which I'm
          pretty sure you haven't done!

          config parameters beginning with a colon are not passed to plugins
          (this should not really affect anyone)

          OTHER CHANGES:

          plugins are now registered as soon as their config section has been
          read

          Dist::Zilla::Role::Stash has been added

          :version can now be passed as a config section value to require that
          the config's package be of the specified version

          reserved config property names (plugin_name, zilla) are now fatal
          during config read rather than plugin instantiation

          core license attrs will look in the %Rights stash for defaults

          `dzil new` will work if you have no configured profiles

          generated Makefile.PL no longer has trailing spaces (Florian Ragwitz)

          Document 'user' parameter for :FakeRelease (Kent Fredric)

          will probably work just fine on Win32 now!

          unixify all gathered filenames (Christian Walde)

          ModuleBuild can use a custom M::B class (David Golden, Dave Rolsky)

          set release_status distmeta based on is_trial (Apocalypse)

          PkgVersion ignores packages which have a newline between the package
          keyword and the package name (Dave Rolsky)

          add version to :ExecFiles (scripts) as well as libraries with
          PkgVersion and PodVersion

          added --in option to the 'build' command (Marcel Gruenauer)

          the ->prereq method on Dist::Zilla is gone (only prereqs remains)

          distmeta is managed by CPAN::Meta, which expects v2 spec data by
          default

          most Dist::Zilla::Types are gone, now in MooseX::Types::Perl

          OTHER CHANGES:

          META.json and META.yml are now produced by CPAN::Meta

          Dist::Zilla::Prereqs now proxies for CPAN::Meta::Prereqs

          MetaResources supports CPAN Meta Spec version 2, but still works
            with old-style resources as well (Dave Rolsky)

          quote filenames with spaces in MANIFEST (Dave Rolsky)

          Manifest plugin is now a FileGatherer, not an InstallTool

          attempted a fix for `dzil install` on Win32 (RT #57404)

2.101151  2010-04-25 23:40:28 America/New_York
          GatherDir and PruneCruft now both have verbose log output

          the App config system has been moved and made non-public; it was
          crazy and awful

          version numbers are not validated by version.pm, not my own dumb
          regex

          `dzil clean` no longer removes backup~ files (sorry, jq)

          TestRelease is better about picking a build location (Christopher J.
