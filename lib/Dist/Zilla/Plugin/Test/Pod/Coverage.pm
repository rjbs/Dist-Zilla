=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an extension of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles>, providing the
following files:

  xt/release/pod-coverage.t - a standard Test::Pod::Coverage test

This test uses L<Pod::Coverage::TrustPod> to check your Pod coverage.  This
means that to indicate that some subs should be treated as covered, even if no
documentation can be found, you can add:

  =for Pod::Coverage sub_name other_sub this_one_too
