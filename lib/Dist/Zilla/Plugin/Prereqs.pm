package Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs;
# ABSTRACT: list simple prerequisites
use Moose;
with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::PrereqSource';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [Prereqs]
  Foo::Bar = 1.002
  MRO::Compat = 10
  Sub::Exporter = 0

Which is equivalent to specifying prerequisites for the C<Runtime>
phase:

  [Prereqs / RuntimeRequires]
  Foo::Bar = 1.002
  MRO::Compat = 10
  Sub::Exporter = 0

See L</Phases> for the full list of supported phases.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds "fixed" prerequisites to your distribution.  These are prereqs
with a known, fixed minimum version that doens't change based on platform or
other conditions.

You can specify prerequisites for different phases and kinds of relationships.
In C<RuntimeRequires>, the phase is Runtime and the relationship is Requires.
These are described in more detail in the L<CPAN::Meta
specification|CPAN::Meta::Spec/PREREQUISITES>.

The phases are:

=for :list
* configure
* build
* test
* runtime
* develop

The relationship types are:

=for :list
* requires
* recommends
* suggests
* conflicts

Not all of these phases are useful for all tools, especially tools that only
understand version 1.x CPAN::Meta files.
