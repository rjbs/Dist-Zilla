package Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs;
# ABSTRACT: list simple prerequisites
use Moose;
with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::PrereqSource';

use namespace::autoclean;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [Prereqs]
  Foo::Bar = 1.002
  MRO::Compat = 10
  Sub::Exporter = 0

You can specify requirements for different phases and relationships with:

  [Prereqs]
  -phase = test
  -relationship = recommends

  Fitz::Fotz    = 1.23
  Text::SoundEx = 3

Remember that if you load two Prereqs plugins, each will needs its own name,
added like this:

  [Prereqs / PluginName]
  -phase = test
  -relationship = recommends

  Fitz::Fotz    = 1.23
  Text::SoundEx = 3

If the name is the CamelCase concatenation of a phase and relationship
(or just a relationship), it will set those parameters implicitly.  If
you use a custom name, but it does not specify the relationship, and
you didn't specify either C<-phase> or C<-relationship>, it throws the
error C<No -phase or -relationship specified>.  This is to prevent a
typo that makes the name meaningless from slipping by unnoticed.

The example below is equivalent to the example above, except for the name of
the resulting plugin:

  [Prereqs / TestRecommends]
  Fitz::Fotz    = 1.23
  Text::SoundEx = 3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds "fixed" prerequisites to your distribution.  These are prereqs
with a known, fixed minimum version that doesn't change based on platform or
other conditions.

You can specify prerequisites for different phases and kinds of relationships.
In C<RuntimeRequires>, the phase is Runtime and the relationship is Requires.
These are described in more detail in the L<CPAN::Meta
specification|CPAN::Meta::Spec/PREREQUISITES>.

The phases are:

=for :list
* configure
* build
* test
* runtime
* develop

The relationship types are:

=for :list
* requires
* recommends
* suggests
* conflicts

If the phase is omitted, it will default to I<runtime>; thus, specifying
"Prereqs / Recommends" in your dist.ini is equivalent to I<RuntimeRecommends>.

Not all of these phases are useful for all tools, especially tools that only
understand version 1.x CPAN::Meta files.
