# ABSTRACT: gather all the files in a directory and use them as templates

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of the L<GatherDir|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir>
plugin.  It works just like its parent class, except that each
gathered file is processed through L<Text::Template>.

The variables C<$plugin> and C<$dist> will be provided to the
template, set to the GatherDir::Template plugin and the Dist::Zilla
object, respectively.

It is meant to be used when minting dists with C<dzil new>, but could be used
in building existing dists, too.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 rename

Use this to rename files while they are being gathered.  This is a list of
key/value pairs, specified thus:

    [GatherDir::Template]
    rename.DISTNAME = $dist->name =~ s/...//r
    rename.DISTVER  = $dist->version

This example will replace the tokens C<DISTNAME> and C<DISTVER> with the
expressions they are associated with. These expressions will be treated as
though they were miniature Text::Template sections, and hence will receive the
same variables that the file itself receives, i.e. C<$dist> and C<$plugin>.
