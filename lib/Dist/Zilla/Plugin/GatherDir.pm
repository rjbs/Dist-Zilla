# ABSTRACT: gather all the files in a directory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a very, very simple L<FileGatherer|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer>
plugin.  It looks in the directory named in the L</root> attribute and adds all
the files it finds there.  If the root begins with a tilde, the tilde is
replaced with the current user's home directory according to L<File::HomeDir>.

Almost every dist will be built with one GatherDir plugin, since it's the
easiest way to get files from disk into your dist.  Most users just need:

  [GatherDir]

...and this will pick up all the files from the current directory into the
dist.  You can use it multiple times, as you can any other plugin, by providing
a plugin name.  For example, if you want to include external specification
files into a subdir of your dist, you might write:

  [GatherDir]
  ; this plugin needs no config and gathers most of your files

  [GatherDir / SpecFiles]
  ; this plugin gets all the files in the root dir and adds them under ./spec
  root   = ~/projects/my-project/spec
  prefix = spec

=attr root

This is the directory in which to look for files.  If not given, it defaults to
the dist root -- generally, the place where your F<dist.ini> or other
configuration file is located.

=cut

has root => (
  is   => 'ro',
  isa  => Dir,
  lazy => 1,
  coerce   => 1,
  required => 1,
  default  => sub { shift->zilla->root },
);

=attr prefix

This parameter can be set to gather all the files found under a common
directory.  See the L<description|DESCRIPTION> above for an example.

=cut

has prefix => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => 'Str',
  default => '',
);

=attr include_dotfiles

By default, files will not be included if they begin with a dot.  This goes
both for files and for directories relative to the C<root>.

In almost all cases, the default value (false) is correct.

=cut

has include_dotfiles => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => 'Bool',
  default => 0,
);

=attr follow_symlinks

By default, directories that are symlinks will not be followed. Note on the
other hand that in all followed directories, files which are symlinks are
always gathered.

=cut

has follow_symlinks => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => 'Bool',
  default => 0,
);

sub mvp_multivalue_args { qw(exclude_filename exclude_match) }

=attr exclude_filename

To exclude certain files from being gathered, use the C<exclude_filename>
option. This may be used multiple times to specify multiple files to exclude.

=cut

has exclude_filename => (
  is   => 'ro',
  isa  => 'ArrayRef',
  default => sub { [] },
);

=attr exclude_match

This is just like C<exclude_filename> but provides a regular expression
pattern.  Files matching the pattern are not gathered.  This may be used
multiple times to specify multiple patterns to exclude.

=cut

has exclude_match => (
  is   => 'ro',
  isa  => 'ArrayRef',
  default => sub { [] },
);
