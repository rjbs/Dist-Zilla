=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will add a F<META.yml> file to the distribution.

For more information on this file, see L<Module::Build::API> and L<CPAN::Meta>.

=attr filename

If given, parameter allows you to specify an alternate name for the generated
file.  It defaults, of course, to F<META.yml>.

=cut

has filename => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => 'Str',
  default => 'META.yml',
);

=attr version

This parameter lets you pick what version of the spec to use when generating
the output.  It defaults to 1.4, the most commonly supported version at
present.

B<This may change without notice in the future.>

Once version 2 of the META file spec is more widely supported, this may default
to 2.

has version => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => 'Num',
  default => '1.4',

      # Okay, this code is all stuff that makes rjbs cry, but it's all his
      # fault, too, because he wasn't really strict about text vs. bytes to
      # begin with.  Why not?  Because he was lazy.  He is very sorry, please
      # do not be too hard with him.  He mostly lives in an ASCII neighborhood,
      # and sometimes doesn't notice his own privilege.
      #
      # There are a few possibilities:
      #   1) It's all ASCII.  Whatevs.
      #   2) It's code points 0x00 to 0xFF and...
      #     a) it's Latin-1/Unicode text
      #     b) it's UTF-8
      #   3) It has code points above 0xFF and must be Unicode.
      #   4) Some stupid nonsense that I don't care about.
      #
      # In (1) we output the codepoints as is.
      # In (3) we can encode to UTF-8 and feel pretty good about that.
      # In (4) I don't give a darn.
      #
      # Between the other cases, the question is: did we get text or octets?
      # We *should* be sure that it's all text, but right now it's usually
      # octets.  If the document is a valid UTF-8 string, we emit it as is.  If
      # it's not, we assume it's text and encode it to UTF-8.
