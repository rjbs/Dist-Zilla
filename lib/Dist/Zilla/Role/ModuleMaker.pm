Plugins implementing this role have their C<make_module> method called for each
module requesting creation by the plugin with this name.  It is passed a
hashref with the following data:

  name - the name of the module to make (a MooseX::Types::Perl::ModuleName)

Classes composing this role also compose

file for the module being created.
