=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plugins implementing this role have their C<test> method called when
testing.  It's passed the root directory of the build test dir and an
optional hash reference of arguments.  Valid arguments include:

=for :list
* jobs -- if parallel testing is supported, this indicates how many to run at once

=method test

This method should throw an exception on failure.

=cut

requires 'test';

=attr default_jobs

This attribute is the default value that should be used as the C<jobs> argument
to the C<test> method.

=cut

has default_jobs => (
  is      => 'ro',
  isa     => 'Int', # non-negative
  default => 1,
);

around dump_config => sub {
  my ($orig, $self) = @_;
  my $config = $self->$orig;

  $config->{'' . __PACKAGE__} = { default_jobs => $self->default_jobs };

  return $config;
};
