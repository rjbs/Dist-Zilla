=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dzil build [ --trial ] [ --trial-num=# ] [ --tgz | --no-tgz ] [ --in /path/to/build/dir ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is a very thin layer over the Dist::Zilla C<build> method, which
does all the things required to build your distribution.  By default, it will
also archive your distribution and leave you with a complete, ready-to-release
distribution tarball.

To go a bit further in depth, the C<build> command will do two things:

=over

=item

Generate a directory containing your module, C<Foo-0.100>. This directory is
complete. You could create a gzipped tarball from this directory and upload it
directly to C<PAUSE> if you so desired. You could C<cd> into this directory and
test your module on Perl installations where you don't have C<Dist::Zilla>, for
example.

This is a default behavior of the C<build> command. You can alter where it puts
the directory with C<--in /path/to/build/dir>.

=item

Generate a gzipped tarball of your module, C<Foo-0.100.tar.gz>. This file
could be uploaded directly to C<PAUSE> to make a release of your module if you
wanted. Or, you can test your module: C<cpanm --test-only Foo-0.100.tar.gz>.
This is the same thing you would get if you compressed the directory described
above.

The gzipped tarball is generated by default, but if you don't want it to be
generated, you can pass the C<--no-tgz> option. In that case, it would only
generate the directory described above.

=back

Once you're done testing or publishing your build, you can clean up everything
with a C<dzil clean>.

=head1 EXAMPLE

  $ dzil build
  $ dzil build --no-tgz
  $ dzil build --in /path/to/build/dir

=cut

sub opt_spec {
  [ 'trial'  => 'build a trial release that PAUSE will not index'      ],
  [ 'trial-num=i' => 'optional trial release number (implies --trial)' ],
  [ 'tgz!'   => 'build a tarball (default behavior)', { default => 1 } ],
  [ 'in=s'   => 'the directory in which to build the distribution'     ]
}

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --trial

This will build a trial distribution.  Among other things, it will generally
mean that the built tarball's basename ends in F<-TRIAL>.

=head2 --trial-num

Specifies an optional trial release number and implies C<--trial>.  This will
be appended to the built tarball's trial designation, e.g. F<-TRIAL9>.

=head2 --tgz | --no-tgz

Builds a .tar.gz in your project directory after building the distribution.

--tgz behaviour is by default, use --no-tgz to disable building an archive.

=head2 --in

Specifies the directory into which the distribution should be built.  If
necessary, the directory will be created.  An archive will not be created.
