=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dist::Zilla builds distributions of code to be uploaded to the CPAN.  In this
respect, it is like L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>, L<Module::Build>, or
L<Module::Install>.  Unlike those tools, however, it is not also a system for
installing code that has been downloaded from the CPAN.  Since it's only run by
authors, and is meant to be run on a repository checkout rather than on
published, released code, it can do much more than those tools, and is free to
make much more ludicrous demands in terms of prerequisites.

If you have access to the web, you can learn more and find an interactive
tutorial at B<L<dzil.org|http://dzil.org/>>.  If not, try
L<Dist::Zilla::Tutorial>.

has chrome => (
  is  => 'rw',
  isa => role_type('Dist::Zilla::Role::Chrome'),

);

=attr name

The name attribute (which is required) gives the name of the distribution to be
built.  This is usually the name of the distribution's main module, with the
double colons (C<::>) replaced with dashes.  For example: C<Dist-Zilla>.

=cut

has name => (
  is   => 'ro',
  isa  => DistName,

=attr version

This is the version of the distribution to be created.

=attr release_status

This attribute sets the release status to one of the
L<CPAN::META::Spec|https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec#release_status>
values: 'stable', 'testing' or 'unstable'.

If the C<$ENV{RELEASE_STATUS}> environment variable exists, its value will
be used as the release status.

For backwards compatibility, if C<$ENV{RELEASE_STATUS}> does not exist and
the C<$ENV{TRIAL}> variable is true, the release status will be 'testing'.

Otherwise, the release status will be set from a
L<ReleaseStatusProvider|Dist::Zilla::Role::ReleaseStatusProvider>, if one
has been configured.

For backwards compatibility, setting C<is_trial> true in F<dist.ini> is
equivalent to using a C<ReleaseStatusProvider>.  If C<is_trial> is false,
it has no effect.

Only B<one> C<ReleaseStatusProvider> may be used.

If no providers are used, the release status defaults to 'stable' unless there
is an "_" character in the version, in which case, it defaults to 'testing'.

=attr abstract

This is a one-line summary of the distribution.  If none is given, one will be
looked for in the L</main_module> of the dist.

=cut

";
    }

    return $abstract;
  }
);

=attr main_module

This is the module where Dist::Zilla might look for various defaults, like
the distribution abstract.  By default, it's derived from the distribution
name.  If your distribution is Foo-Bar, and F<lib/Foo/Bar.pm> exists,
that's the main_module.  Otherwise, it's the shortest-named module in the
distribution.  This may change!

You can override the default by specifying the file path explicitly,
ie:

  main_module = lib/Foo/Bar.pm

=attr license

This is the L<Software::License|Software::License> object for this dist's
license and copyright.

It will be created automatically, if possible, with the
C<copyright_holder> and C<copyright_year> attributes.  If necessary, it will
try to guess the license from the POD of the dist's main module.

A better option is to set the C<license> name in the dist's config to something
understandable, like C<Perl_5>.

Non-core code should avoid altering this arrayref, but sometimes there is not
other way to change the list of files.  In the future, the representation used

This attribute stores a L<Log::Dispatchouli::Proxy> object, used to log

=head1 STABILITY PROMISE

None.

I will try not to break things within any major release.  Minor releases are
not extensively tested before release.  In major releases, anything goes,
although I will try to publish a complete list of known breaking changes in any
major release.

If Dist::Zilla was a tool, it would have yellow and black stripes and there
would be no L<UL
certification|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UL_(safety_organization)> on it.
It is nasty, brutish, and large.

=head1 SUPPORT

There are usually people on C<irc.perl.org> in C<#distzilla>, even if they're
idling.

The L<Dist::Zilla website|http://dzil.org/> has several valuable resources for
learning to use Dist::Zilla.

There is a mailing list to discuss Dist::Zilla.  You can L<join the
list|http://www.listbox.com/subscribe/?list_id=139292> or L<browse the
archives|http://listbox.com/member/archive/139292>.
